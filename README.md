# ConnectIQ

The Connect IQ Mobile SDK allows companion iOS applications to be created that interact with Monkey C applications running on Garmin wearable devices. This allows feature-rich user experiences to be built by retrieving remote data or offloading resource-intensive tasks from the wearable device to the iOS device.
